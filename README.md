# 🎓 Student Success Prediction System

An AI-powered platform that helps K-12 educators identify at-risk students early and implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes. Features **GPT-enhanced AI insights** with database persistence and intelligent caching for personalized student recommendations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the application
python3 run_mvp.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:8001
# Default API key: dev-key-change-me
```

## ✨ What It Does

- **🤖 AI Risk Prediction**: Identifies students at risk using 81.5% AUC K-12 specialized neural network
- **🧠 GPT AI Insights**: Database-backed personalized recommendations with intelligent caching
- **📊 Explainable AI**: Shows why students are at risk with detailed, actionable explanations
- **🎯 Intervention Management**: Create and track interventions with real-time status updates
- **📈 Live Dashboard**: Real-time analytics and progress monitoring without page refreshes
- **📚 Multi-Platform**: Canvas LMS, PowerSchool SIS, Google Classroom, and generic CSV support

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Upload**: Canvas LMS gradebook, PowerSchool export, or CSV file
2. **Analyze**: K-12 specialized AI processes student data and predicts risk levels  
3. **Generate AI Insights**: GPT analyzes actual student data for personalized recommendations
4. **Explain**: View detailed risk factors and protective factors with confidence scores
5. **Intervene**: Create and assign targeted interventions with status tracking
6. **Monitor**: Track progress with real-time dashboard updates and intervention outcomes
