# ðŸ“Š K-12 Dataset Research for Model Retraining

## Overview
Moving from higher education (OULAD) to K-12 specific datasets to improve model relevance and accuracy for school districts.

## Available K-12 Datasets

### 1. **EdFacts Initiative (US Department of Education)**
- **Source**: https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/
- **Data**: State and district-level academic performance
- **Includes**: Graduation rates, test scores, demographics, special populations
- **Grades**: K-12
- **Privacy**: Aggregated, FERPA compliant

### 2. **Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)**
- **Source**: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/data.html
- **Data**: School-level data on student equity and opportunity
- **Includes**: Demographics, discipline, AP courses, special education
- **Grades**: K-12
- **Privacy**: School-level aggregation

### 3. **National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)**
- **Source**: https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/
- **Data**: Academic achievement samples
- **Includes**: Reading, math scores with demographics
- **Grades**: 4, 8, 12
- **Privacy**: Statistical samples, no individual data

### 4. **Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA)**
- **Source**: https://edopportunity.org/
- **Data**: Academic achievement and opportunity
- **Includes**: Test scores, demographics, economic data
- **Grades**: 3-8
- **Privacy**: District and school aggregates

### 5. **PISA (International)**
- **Source**: https://www.oecd.org/pisa/
- **Data**: 15-year-old academic performance internationally
- **Includes**: Reading, math, science with socioeconomic factors
- **Grades**: ~9-10 (age 15)
- **Privacy**: Anonymous student-level data

### 6. **Synthetic K-12 Dataset Generation**
- **Approach**: Generate realistic synthetic data based on real K-12 patterns
- **Benefits**: Full control, privacy-compliant, customizable
- **Tools**: DataSynthesizer, SDV, custom generation

## K-12 Specific Feature Categories

### **Academic Performance**
- Grade-level standardized test scores (state tests, NAEP)
- Course grades by subject and semester
- GPA trends across grade levels
- Credit accumulation and course completion rates

### **Demographics & Socioeconomic**
- Grade level (K, 1, 2, ..., 12)
- Age-grade alignment (over/under age for grade)
- Free/reduced lunch eligibility
- English Language Learner (ELL) status
- Special education services (IEP, 504 plans)
- Race/ethnicity
- Family structure and mobility

### **Engagement & Behavior**
- Attendance rates and chronic absenteeism
- Tardiness patterns
- Disciplinary incidents and suspensions
- Extracurricular participation
- Parent engagement metrics

### **Early Warning Indicators**
- Course failures (especially core subjects)
- Reading proficiency by grade 3
- Math proficiency progression
- Grade retention history
- School transfers and mobility

### **Support Services**
- Tutoring and intervention participation
- Counseling services utilization
- Special program enrollment (gifted, remedial)
- Technology access and usage

## Recommended Approach

### **Phase 1: Synthetic Data Generation**
Create realistic K-12 synthetic dataset with:
- 10,000+ students across grades K-12
- Multi-year longitudinal tracking
- Realistic correlation patterns from research literature
- Grade-specific success metrics

### **Phase 2: Feature Engineering Adaptation**
Adapt existing features for K-12 context:
- Replace university-specific features with K-12 equivalents
- Add grade-level progression tracking
- Include early warning indicators
- Model developmental differences by grade band

### **Phase 3: Model Architecture Updates**
- Grade-level specific models (elementary, middle, high school)
- Multi-output prediction (next grade success, graduation likelihood)
- Temporal modeling for longitudinal tracking
- Intervention timing optimization

## Success Metrics for K-12

### **Elementary (K-5)**
- Reading proficiency by grade 3
- Math concept mastery
- Social-emotional development indicators
- Attendance patterns

### **Middle School (6-8)**
- Course performance trends
- Engagement drop indicators
- Peer relationship factors
- Transition readiness

### **High School (9-12)**
- Credit accumulation on track
- Graduation likelihood
- College/career readiness
- Post-secondary preparation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Generate synthetic K-12 dataset** based on research patterns
2. **Adapt feature engineering** for K-12 context
3. **Retrain models** with grade-level considerations
4. **Validate against K-12 benchmarks** from literature
5. **Update explainable AI** with K-12 terminology
6. **Test with real district data** (pilot program)

This approach will create a much more relevant and effective system for actual K-12 educators while maintaining privacy compliance.
