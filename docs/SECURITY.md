### üîç Input Validation

**Comprehensive Data Validation**

**Gradebook Processing Security**
- Format detection without code execution
- Safe pandas operations with error handling
- Memory usage limits for large datasets
- Timeout protection for processing operations

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.security` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Essential security settings
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-256-bit-secret-key
ADMIN_API_KEY=admin-secure-random-key
TEACHER_API_KEY=teacher-secure-random-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,api.yourdomain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false
```

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Configure ALLOWED_HOSTS and ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- [ ] Set DEVELOPMENT_MODE=false
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Use strong database credentials
- [ ] Remove default/demo credentials

#### üü° Important (Complete Within 1 Week)

- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Implement database backups with encryption
- [ ] Set up firewall rules and network segmentation
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (Nginx) with security headers
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning

#### üü¢ Recommended (Complete Within 1 Month)

- [ ] Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection system (IDS)
- [ ] Configure security incident response procedures
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up penetration testing schedule
- [ ] Create security training program

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Validate all input** at API boundaries
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Log security events** without exposing sensitive data
5. **Keep dependencies updated** with security patches
6. **Follow principle of least privilege** for access control

### For System Administrators

1. **Regular security updates** for OS and dependencies
2. **Network segmentation** between components
3. **Monitoring and alerting** for suspicious activities
4. **Regular backups** with tested restore procedures
5. **Access logging and audit trails**
6. **Incident response plan** and procedures

### For End Users

1. **Use strong, unique API keys**
2. **Rotate keys regularly** (quarterly recommended)
3. **Monitor usage logs** for suspicious activity
4. **Report security incidents** immediately
5. **Keep client applications updated**

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security@yourdomain.com with details
3. **Include** steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Allow** reasonable time for response and fix
5. **Follow** responsible disclosure principles

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Failed authentication attempts per IP
- Rate limit violations and patterns
- File upload sizes and types
- Database query patterns and performance
- Error rates and exception patterns
- Memory and CPU usage anomalies

### Alerting Thresholds

- **Critical**: Multiple failed auth attempts from same IP
- **Critical**: Large file uploads outside business hours
- **Warning**: Unusual traffic patterns or volume
- **Warning**: High error rates or slow response times
- **Info**: New IP addresses accessing the system

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

- **FERPA Compliance**: Educational records protection
- **GDPR Considerations**: EU student data handling
- **COPPA Requirements**: Under-13 student data protection
- **State Privacy Laws**: Local educational privacy requirements

### Audit Requirements

- **Access Logging**: Who accessed what data when
- **Data Retention**: How long data is stored
- **Data Deletion**: Secure data removal procedures
- **Change Tracking**: System configuration changes

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- **Dependency scanning**: `pip audit` for vulnerable packages
- **Static code analysis**: Security linting and code review
- **Unit tests**: Security function validation
- **Integration tests**: End-to-end security flow testing

### Manual Testing

- **Penetration testing**: Quarterly external assessment
- **Code review**: Security-focused peer review
- **Configuration review**: Security setting validation
- **Incident simulation**: Response procedure testing

## Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- **Weekly**: Dependency update review
- **Monthly**: Security log analysis
- **Quarterly**: Penetration testing
- **Annually**: Full security audit

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Immediate**: Disable affected services
2. **Within 1 hour**: Assess impact and containment
3. **Within 4 hours**: Implement fixes and patches
4. **Within 24 hours**: Complete incident report
5. **Within 1 week**: Update procedures and training
