## **REMAINING TASKS (Priority Order)**

### **PRIORITY 1: INPUT VALIDATION & SANITIZATION**

**Current Risk:** Insufficient input validation across endpoints

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive validation layer

```python
# Required Implementation
class ProductionValidator:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_csv_file(file_content: bytes, filename: str):
        # File size, format, content validation
        # Malware scanning integration
        # CSV structure validation
        pass
    
    @staticmethod  
    def sanitize_user_input(data: dict) -> dict:
        # XSS prevention
        # SQL injection prevention
        # Input length limits
        pass
```

**Files to create:**
- `src/mvp/validators.py`
- `src/mvp/sanitizers.py`

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 days

### **PRIORITY 2: INTELLIGENT CACHING LAYER**

**Current Risk:** ML model predictions recalculated unnecessarily

**Recommendation:** Add prediction caching with intelligent invalidation

```python
# Required Implementation
class PredictionCache:
    def get_prediction(self, student_data_hash: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        # Return cached prediction if exists and valid
        pass
    
    def cache_prediction(self, student_data_hash: str, prediction: dict, ttl: int = 300):
        # Cache with 5-minute TTL by default
        pass
```

**Production Impact:**
- **50-80% faster response times** for repeated predictions
- **Reduced ML model load** - fewer computations
- **Better user experience** - instant results for similar data

**Files to create:**
- `src/mvp/caching.py`
- Integration with container.py

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days

### **PRIORITY 3: ADVANCED SECURITY HARDENING**

**Current State:** Basic API key authentication

**Production Requirements:**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting per user/endpoint
- Audit logging for compliance (FERPA)
- Session management

**Files to enhance:**
- `src/mvp/security.py` (major refactor)
- `src/mvp/models.py` (User/Session models)

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 days
